# Visual Companion Guide

Browser-based visual brainstorming companion for showing mockups, diagrams, and options.

This is a display tool, not a separate approval workflow. Follow `SKILL.md` for
design decisions and authorization; using the browser adds no approval gates.

## When to Use

Decide per-question, not per-session. The test: **would the user understand this better by seeing it than reading it?**

**Use the browser** when the content itself is visual:

- **UI mockups** — wireframes, layouts, navigation structures, component designs
- **Architecture diagrams** — system components, data flow, relationship maps
- **Side-by-side visual comparisons** — comparing two layouts, two color schemes, two design directions
- **Design polish** — when the question is about look and feel, spacing, visual hierarchy
- **Spatial relationships** — state machines, flowcharts, entity relationships rendered as diagrams

**Use the conversation** when the content is text or tabular:

- **Requirements and scope questions** — "what does X mean?", "which features are in scope?"
- **Conceptual A/B/C choices** — picking between approaches described in words
- **Tradeoff lists** — pros/cons, comparison tables
- **Technical decisions** — API design, data modeling, architectural approach selection
- **Clarifying questions** — anything where the answer is words, not a visual preference

A question *about* a UI topic is not automatically a visual question. "What kind of wizard do you want?" is conceptual — use the conversation. "Which of these wizard layouts feels right?" is visual — use the browser.

## How It Works

The server watches a directory for HTML files and serves the newest one to the browser. You write HTML content to `screen_dir`, the user sees it in their browser and can click to select options. Selections are recorded to `state_dir/events` that you read on your next turn.

**Content fragments vs full documents:** If your HTML file starts with `<!DOCTYPE` or `<html`, the server serves it as-is (just injects the helper script). Otherwise, the server automatically wraps your content in the frame template — adding the header, CSS theme, connection status, and all interactive infrastructure. **Write content fragments by default.** Only write full documents when you need complete control over the page.

## Starting a Session

```bash
# Start when the user requests or accepts the companion. --open opens their
# browser on the first screen; --project-dir persists mockups across restarts.
scripts/start-server.sh --project-dir /path/to/project --open

# Returns: {"type":"server-started","port":52341,
#           "url":"http://localhost:52341/?key=ab12…",
#           "screen_dir":"/path/to/project/.superpowers/brainstorm/12345-1706000000/content",
#           "state_dir":"/path/to/project/.superpowers/brainstorm/12345-1706000000/state"}
```

Save `screen_dir` and `state_dir` from the response. With `--open`, the browser opens itself when you push the first screen — you don't need to ask the user to open it, but still share the URL as a fallback (headless/remote setups won't auto-open).

**The URL contains a session key (`?key=…`).** The server rejects any request
without it, so always give the user the **complete** URL from the `url` field —
never strip the query string, and never hand out a bare `http://host:port`. The
key gates HTTP and WebSocket access so a stray browser tab or another machine on
the network can't read the screens or inject events. After the first load the
browser remembers the key via a cookie, so reloads and `/files/*` assets work
without repeating it.

**Finding connection info:** The server writes its startup JSON to `$STATE_DIR/server-info`. If you launched the server in the background and didn't capture stdout, read that file to get the URL and port. When using `--project-dir`, check `<project>/.superpowers/brainstorm/` for the session directory.

**Note:** Pass the project root as `--project-dir` so mockups persist in `.superpowers/brainstorm/` and survive server restarts. Without it, files go to `/tmp` and get cleaned up. Remind the user to add `.superpowers/` to `.gitignore` if it's not already there.

**Launching the server by platform:**

**Claude Code:**
```bash
# Default mode works — the script backgrounds the server itself.
scripts/start-server.sh --project-dir /path/to/project --open
```

On Windows, the script auto-detects and switches to foreground mode (which blocks the tool call). Use `run_in_background: true` on the Bash tool call so the server survives across conversation turns, then read `$STATE_DIR/server-info` on the next turn to get the URL and port.

**Codex:**
```bash
# Codex reaps background processes. The script auto-detects CODEX_CI and
# switches to foreground mode. Run it normally — no extra flags needed.
scripts/start-server.sh --project-dir /path/to/project --open
```

**Gemini CLI:**
```bash
# Use --foreground and set is_background: true on your shell tool call
# so the process survives across turns
scripts/start-server.sh --project-dir /path/to/project --open --foreground
```

**Copilot CLI:**
```bash
# Start it with Copilot CLI's non-blocking/background shell mechanism so the
# server survives across turns. Keep --foreground so the harness, not the
# script, owns backgrounding. The launcher is a .sh, so invoke it via bash
# (on Windows, call Git Bash's bash.exe from the PowerShell tool).
bash scripts/start-server.sh --project-dir /path/to/project --open --foreground
```

**Other environments:** The server must keep running in the background across conversation turns. If your environment reaps detached processes, use `--foreground` and launch the command with your platform's background execution mechanism.

If the URL is unreachable from your browser (common in remote/containerized setups), bind a non-loopback host:

```bash
scripts/start-server.sh \
  --project-dir /path/to/project \
  --host 0.0.0.0 \
  --url-host localhost
```

Use `--url-host` to control what hostname is printed in the returned URL JSON.

## Presenting and Updating Screens

Before sharing the URL or writing a screen, check that `$STATE_DIR/server-info`
exists and `$STATE_DIR/server-stopped` does not. If stopped, restart with the same
`--project-dir` to reuse the port. The server exits after 4 hours idle by default;
`--idle-timeout-minutes` changes that limit.

Write HTML with the host's file-editing tool to a new, descriptive filename in
`screen_dir`, such as `layout.html` or `layout-v2.html`. The server displays the
newest file. For several views that the user should see together, put them on one
comparison screen or provide the saved artifacts together.

Share the complete URL and a brief explanation when needed. If a consequential
choice remains, ask for it and tell the user to reply in the conversation after
selecting in the browser. Clicks are recorded, but do not start another agent turn.

If the decisions are already settled, complete the requested work without waiting
for approval of each screen. Do not add choices just to fill a comparison layout.

Read `$STATE_DIR/events` when interpreting browser feedback; the conversation is
the primary instruction, and a click does not expand authorization. Update the
screen when feedback changes it. A waiting screen is optional if stale content
would confuse the user, not a required step when returning to the conversation.

## Writing Content Fragments

Write just the content that goes inside the page. The server wraps it in the frame template automatically (header, theme CSS, connection status, and all interactive infrastructure).

**Minimal example:**

```html
<h2>Which layout works better?</h2>
<p class="subtitle">Consider readability and visual hierarchy</p>

<div class="options">
  <div class="option" data-choice="a" onclick="toggleSelect(this)">
    <div class="letter">A</div>
    <div class="content">
      <h3>Single Column</h3>
      <p>Clean, focused reading experience</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="option" data-choice="b" onclick="toggleSelect(this)">
    <div class="letter">B</div>
    <div class="content">
      <h3>Two Column</h3>
      <p>Sidebar navigation with main content</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

That's it. No `<html>`, no CSS, no `<script>` tags needed. The server provides all of that.

## CSS Classes Available

The frame template provides these CSS classes for your content:

### Options (A/B/C choices)

```html
<div class="options">
  <div class="option" data-choice="a" onclick="toggleSelect(this)">
    <div class="letter">A</div>
    <div class="content">
      <h3>Title</h3>
      <p>Description</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

**Multi-select:** Add `data-multiselect` to the container to let users select multiple options. Each click toggles the item's selected styling.

```html
<div class="options" data-multiselect>
  <!-- same option markup — users can select/deselect multiple -->
</div>
```

### Cards (visual designs)

```html
<div class="cards">
  <div class="card" data-choice="design1" onclick="toggleSelect(this)">
    <div class="card-image"><!-- mockup content --></div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <h3>Name</h3>
      <p>Description</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

### Mockup container

```html
<div class="mockup">
  <div class="mockup-header">Preview: Dashboard Layout</div>
  <div class="mockup-body"><!-- your mockup HTML --></div>
</div>
```

### Split view (side-by-side)

```html
<div class="split">
  <div class="mockup"><!-- left --></div>
  <div class="mockup"><!-- right --></div>
</div>
```

### Pros/Cons

```html
<div class="pros-cons">
  <div class="pros"><h4>Pros</h4><ul><li>Benefit</li></ul></div>
  <div class="cons"><h4>Cons</h4><ul><li>Drawback</li></ul></div>
</div>
```

### Mock elements (wireframe building blocks)

```html
<div class="mock-nav">Logo | Home | About | Contact</div>
<div style="display: flex;">
  <div class="mock-sidebar">Navigation</div>
  <div class="mock-content">Main content area</div>
</div>
<button class="mock-button">Action Button</button>
<input class="mock-input" placeholder="Input field">
<div class="placeholder">Placeholder area</div>
```

### Typography and sections

- `h2` — page title
- `h3` — section heading
- `.subtitle` — secondary text below title
- `.section` — content block with bottom margin
- `.label` — small uppercase label text

## Browser Events Format

When the user clicks options in the browser, their interactions are recorded to `$STATE_DIR/events` (one JSON object per line). The file is cleared automatically when you push a new screen.

```jsonl
{"type":"click","choice":"a","text":"Option A - Simple Layout","timestamp":1706000101}
{"type":"click","choice":"c","text":"Option C - Complex Grid","timestamp":1706000108}
{"type":"click","choice":"b","text":"Option B - Hybrid","timestamp":1706000115}
```

The full event stream shows the user's exploration path — they may click multiple options before settling. The last `choice` event is typically the final selection, but the pattern of clicks can reveal hesitation or preferences worth asking about.

If `$STATE_DIR/events` doesn't exist, there are no recorded browser selections to
interpret; use the conversation.

## Design Tips

- **Scale fidelity to the question** — wireframes for layout, polish for polish questions
- **Orient the reader** — name the view being shown or the question being decided
- **Revise when needed** — if feedback changes the current screen, write a new version
- **Show meaningful alternatives only** — there is no required number of options
- **Use real content when it matters** — for a photography portfolio, use actual images (Unsplash). Placeholder content obscures design issues.
- **Keep mockups simple** — focus on layout and structure, not pixel-perfect design

## File Naming

- Use semantic names: `platform.html`, `visual-style.html`, `layout.html`
- Never reuse filenames — each screen must be a new file
- For iterations: append version suffix like `layout-v2.html`, `layout-v3.html`
- Server serves newest file by modification time

## Cleaning Up

```bash
scripts/stop-server.sh $SESSION_DIR
```

If the session used `--project-dir`, mockup files persist in `.superpowers/brainstorm/` for later reference. Only `/tmp` sessions get deleted on stop.
