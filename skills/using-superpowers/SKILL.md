# Using Free Energy Superpowers

Skills are task-specific guidance, not a sequence every request must traverse.
Answer simple questions directly. Do not load a workflow because a keyword happens
to match, re-load unchanged instructions for every follow-up, or announce each skill.

For software design and changes, use `applying-development-principles` as the
engineering standard. Load other skills when they help with the actual task:

- Unresolved product or design choices: `brainstorming`.
- A bug whose cause is unknown: `systematic-debugging`.
- Work needing sequencing or handoff: `writing-plans`, then `executing-plans`.
- Testable behavior changes: `test-driven-development`.
- Completion claims: `verification-before-completion`.
- Material changes needing independent scrutiny: `requesting-code-review`.
- Feedback to evaluate: `receiving-code-review`.
- Workspace isolation or delivery decisions: `using-git-worktrees` or
  `finishing-a-development-branch`.
- Useful, permitted delegation: `dispatching-parallel-agents` or
  `subagent-driven-development`.
- Authoring instructions: `writing-skills`.

Load an explicitly requested skill. Read applicable instructions before relying on
them, using the host's native skill loader or file reader. Read supporting material
only when the main skill calls for it in this task. A subagent with a bounded brief
does not need to repeat the controller's planning workflow.

Host/system rules take precedence. Within those boundaries, follow explicit user
intent and repository rules over generic skill defaults. Skills grant no additional
permission to mutate data, contact people, publish, merge, or delete work.

When tool names differ, trust the tools actually available. The platform references
in `references/` are lookup aids, not prerequisites for ordinary work.
Available mappings: `references/codex-tools.md`, `references/pi-tools.md`,
`references/antigravity-tools.md`, `references/hermes-tools.md`, and
`references/gemini-tools.md`.
